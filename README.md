  <li><strong>Vercel</strong> - frontend deploy</li>
  <li><strong>Cloudinary</strong> - media management</li>
  <li><strong>AWS</strong> - MySQl database</li>

This website is a fully functional blog where users can view posts and register to write their own.

The structure of the posts is straightforward: each post includes a title, a body, a category, and an image. The post images are managed using the Cloudinary service (https://cloudinary.com/).

Every website nowadays should be mobile-friendly, and this blog website is no exception. Users will find an intuitive user interface (UI), and the content is fully responsive across different screen sizes.
